### WELCOME TO LIMITLESS

Our application "Limitless" aims to provide users with a simplistic yet engaging way to record bodybuilding progress.  
Using gameifcation elements, data trackers, and thought-out UI/UX elements.  
The app is created using Django as the backend framework, and Bootstrap to create simple UI elements.

Solving problems from all over the fitness application market in one free web-application.
